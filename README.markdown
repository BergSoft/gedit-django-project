Gedit Django Project
====================

This is a plugin for [Gedit][2], the official text editor of the GNOME desktop
environment. This plugin is for Gedit versions 3 and above. **This plugin is NOT
compatible with Gedit 2.x**.

Gedit Django Project adds GUI interfaces for [django-admin.py and manage.py][1] 
commands within Gedit and simplifies working with Django projects.

__This plugin is very incomplete. Watch this repo for the first workable update. I will
update this README with a feature list, screenshots, and installation instructions.__
